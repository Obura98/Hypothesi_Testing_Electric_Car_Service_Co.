# Hypothesi_Testing_Electric_Car_Service_Co.
## Research Question¶
1. Determine the total number of bluecars taken from stations in Paris between Monday-Friday
### Claim Test
The same total number of bluecars are taken from stations in Paris between Monday and Friday
### Null Hypothesis
There is no difference in the total number of bluecars taken from stations between Monday and Friday.
### Alternative Hypothesis
There is a difference in the total number of bluecars taken from stations between Monday and Friday.
###Metrics of Success
1. Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
2. Get a sample(s) of the data
3.  Determine the p-value
4. Reject or accept/fail to reject the null Hypothesis
5. Plot univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.

3. jupyter matplotlib, seaborn


### Project Description
Just like before, we have been tasked to understand electric car usage by solving for another research question. We will work as a Data Scientist for the Autolib electric car-sharing service company to investigate a claim about the blue cars from the provided Autolib dataset.

In an effort to do this, we need to identify some areas and periods of interest via sampling stating the reason to the choice of method, then perform hypothesis testing with regards to the claim that we will have made. An example of claim to test would be "Is the number of Bluecars taken in area X different than in area Y? Is it greater in area X than in area Z? Etc”. The selected periods of interest be either weekdays or weekends but not a mix of both. You can also consider postal codes 75015 vs 75017 to some of the areas of interest.

To work on this project, we will perform the following analysis with Python;

Find and deal with outliers, anomalies, and missing data within the dataset.
Plot appropriate univariate and bivariate summaries recording our observations.
Implement the solution by performing hypothesis testing.
This will need to be documented when writing the report.

## Dataset Used
